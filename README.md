3/22: Added dialogue, fixed some schedule problems that made a few characters vanish, added Malkin and Shuck sprites that are currently not pathing well (oversized sprites.... sigh.)

4/11 Update (File Name: Fern River (WiP)): Portraits and basic sprites in place for all characters - some are still a bit rough; more progress on basic dialogue; basic schedule in place for Story, Fable, Ojistah and Adejens; changed town map to increase the size of the bandstand square, increasing the number of sprites that fit in
